# Mp4ToMp3Convertor

Convert MP4 to MP3 using a simple convertor made in WPF C# 4.7+<br />
This was made on request by a friend, but the code is open source!<br />
Copy pasted my code to a github repo for anyone who likes to use this
<br />
<br />
The convertor works but if you think anything can be done better feel free to edit to your own favor
<br />
